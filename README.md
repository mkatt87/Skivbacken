🎛️ Backmagic

Backmagic is your personal Spotify crate digger — a smart and magical playlist generator that lets you remix your favorite music with control, randomness, or pure vibe.

With options to:

🎚️ Choose number of tracks (10 to 10,000)

🌙 Adjust mood: more chill or more energy

⚡ Include or avoid electronic music

🎲 Shuffle and select genres — or type your own

🧠 Use AI to describe the kind of playlist you want (e.g. "70s disco kraut mix" or "late-night mellow haze")

🎧 Focus on your rarely played or most loved tracks


Generated playlists are automatically named Backmagic YYMMDD, and include a timestamp, number of songs, and 10 randomly selected genres in the description.
